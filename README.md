# ARM_analysis

This repo performs a precipitation-buoyancy analysis using [ARMBE](https://www.arm.gov/capabilities/science-data-products/vaps/armbe) data. 
The following steps are performed:
1. The atmosphere is divided into a boundary layer and a lower-free troposphere.
2. The equivalent potential temperature, $\theta_e$
1. A lower-tropospheric buoyancy is computed using temperature and specific humidity profiles from quality-controlled soundings.
   

Each buoyancy
environment is then matched to its typical precipitation value.
